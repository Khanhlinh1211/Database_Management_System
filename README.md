# Database Management System
## Description of the Datasets
In this project, we will use the Northwind database, which contains sales data for a hypothetical corporation called "Northwind Traders," which imports and exports exotic goods from around the world.

## About the Datasets 
You can download the Northwind database from my GitHub repo. Here’s the two files you’ll need:
  <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/Khanhlinh1211/Database_Management_System/blob/main/sample-model.sql">sample-model.sql which creates tables and other database objects</a>  </li>
      <li> sample-data.sql which loads the sample data into Northwind </li>
  </ul>
  
    Suppliers: Suppliers and vendors of Northwind
    Customers: Customers who buy products from Northwind
    Products: Product information
    Orders and Order_Details: Sales Order transactions taking place between the customers & the company
