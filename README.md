# Database Management System
## Description of the Datasets
In this project, we will use the Northwind database, which contains sales data for a hypothetical corporation called "Northwind Traders," which imports and exports exotic goods from around the world.

## About the Datasets 
You can download the Northwind database from my GitHub repo. Here’s the two files you’ll need:
  <ul>
      <li> sample-model.sql which creates tables and other database objects </li>
      <li> sample-data.sql which loads the sample data into Northwind </li>

  </ul>

This is the Compact Northwind Database's combined entity diagram:
